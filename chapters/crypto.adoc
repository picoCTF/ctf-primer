== Cryptography

Cryptography is an ancient field that dates to Ancient Rome. Etymologically, the word traces back to the Greek roots "kryptos" meaning "hidden" and "graphein" meaning "to write." It is used to communicate secretly in the presence of an enemy. With cryptography we can achieve the following properties when a message is sent:


*Confidentiality: No one unintended will be able to read the message.

*Integrity: If a message is tampered, it is possible to detect that it was.

*Authentication: The identity of a person can be verified accurately.

*Nonrepudiation: If a person sent a specific message, then the person cannot deny that the message was sent by them.


First, we will see how to achieve Confidentiality. This is done with encryption. When we want to hide a message, we say that we encrypt the message. To understand how encryption works, we will see an example of an ancient way of encrypting a message that is not secure by any means today, but it is good for illustration. But first, to practice our terminal skills, we will encrypt a folder in linux to prevent anyone from reading its contents without the appropriate password.

=== Practical example


To use cryptography in real life, you should never use your own implementations. To begin, we will demonstrate how to encrypt a file, without any knowledge in cryptography. Go to the picoCTF webshell at:

https://webshell.picoctf.org/

When you are there, create a file called 'my_name.txt' containing your name. You could use the 'nano' editor, but in linux it is possible to do the following trick: If your name was 'samuel', you would run the following command to create the text file:

[source, txt]
echo "samuel" > my_name.txt

The 'echo' command simply outputs a string, and we are redirecting that output to a file. For example, if we just run

[source, txt]
echo "samuel"

You will simple see 'samuel' printed on the screen. Now run: 

[source, txt]
ls

and you will see the file you created:

[source, txt]
ls
my_name.txt

If you run the command: 

[source, txt]
cat my_name.txt 

you will see the content:

[source, txt]
cat my_name.txt 
samuel


Now, create another file with your last name called 'my_lastname.txt'. You can use the same technique to create 'my_lastname.txt':

[source, txt]
echo "pardo" > my_lastname.txt


We will move both files to a new folder, then compress that folder, and then encrypt it! Compressing a folder just makes several files or folders to appear as a single file, and they would take less space on disk, but compressing does not provide any security. Anyone would be able to simply decompress it and see the original content. However, encryption will prevent obtaining the original content without the key. To do that experiment, create a directory called my info:

[source, txt]
mkdir my_info

And move both files inside using the command mv (mv means move):

[source, txt]
mv my_name.txt my_info/
mv my_lastname.txt my_info/

Navigate to the folder 'my_info' and make sure that it contains the files. Now, come back outside my_info folder, and compress the folder into a zip file by running:

[source, txt]
zip -r my_info.zip my_info/

Note that my_info.zip is the name we chose for our compressed file, and '-r' means recursively, which in this case means that we want to compress everything inside the folder. If you run
 
[source, txt]
ls
 
You should see the folder and the compressed file:

[source, txt]
ls
my_info  my_info.zip

Now remove the folder by running:

[source, txt]
rm -r my_info

'rm' means remove, and '-r' means recursively and indicates we want to remove everything in the folder:

[source, txt]
rm -r my_info

Now, if you run 

[source, txt]
ls 

you should see only your compressed file:

[source, txt]
ls
my_info.zip


You could easily uncompress the folder by running:

[source, txt]
unzip my_info.zip

And obtain the original folder:

[source, txt]
ls
my_info  my_info.zip


Now, let's create a zip file protected with encryption, so it cannot be uncompressed without a key. In this context, the words  'key' and 'password' are synonyms.

Let's first remove the .zip file we already created by running:

[source, txt]
rm my_info.zip

Now, let's create our encrypted zip, by using a password, with the following command:

[source, txt]
zip --encrypt -r my_protected_info.zip my_info/

You will be asked to input a password and verify it, so remember the password you use to be able to decrypt it later:

[source, txt]
zip --encrypt -r my_protected_info.zip my_info/
Enter password: 
Verify password: 
  adding: my_info/ (stored 0%)
  adding: my_info/my_name.txt (stored 0%)
  adding: my_info/my_lastname.txt (stored 0%)

If you  run:

[source, txt]
unzip my_protected_info.zip 

It will ask for the password, and only if you input the correct password, you will get back the original content!

[source, txt]
Archive:  my_protected_info.zip
   creating: my_info/
[my_protected_info.zip] my_info/my_name.txt password: 
 extracting: my_info/my_name.txt     
 extracting: my_info/my_lastname.txt 

It is not possible to obtain the original content without the password because it is used to do operations with the content to obtain the resulting encrypted file. At this point you might have no idea of what happened. There are many algorithms for encryption, that were created since the antique Rome. Old ways of encrypting data are easily broken nowadays. Even relatively new ways of encrypting data are broken easily today. Some of them are considered unbreakable right now, but will be broken in the future.  Let's begin to understand how encryption works!


=== Substitution ciphers

"Cipher" means a secret or disguised way of writing a message. It can be thought as the same as encryption. One cipher method invented in the antique Rome and named after the emperor Julius Caesar who used it for his private communication is Caesar's cipher. This cipher simply substitutes each of the letters of a word by another one that is a certain number of positions further in the alphabet. That "certain number of positions" is called the shift. For example, if we have the word "hello" and we want to encrypt it using Caesar's cipher with a shift of 3, we would replace the 'h' by 'k' because 'k' is 3 positions further in the alphabet, the 'e' by 'h' for the same reason, and so on. We called the original text we want to encrypt the cleartext or plaintext. The result of encrypting 'hello' using Caesar's with a shift of 3, is the following:

cleartext -> h e l l o

Encrypted text -> k h o o r

"Decrypting" means obtaining the clear text from the encrypted text. For Caesar's cipher we simply do the same but in reverse; we subtract 3 positions in the alphabet to each letter.

Note that when we get to the end of the alphabet after adding positions while encrypting something, we simply overlap the alphabet. For example, to encrypt the letter 'z', we would encrypt it using the letter 'c'.

To make sure you understand the decryption, decrypt the following text using Caesar cipher with a shift of 3:

s l f r f w i

The result is something you probably know. Hint: the first decrypted letter is 'p' .

Caesar's cipher is a *substitution cipher*, because it replaces each letter by something else. In a substitution cipher, you don't necessarily need to replace a letter by another letter. You can use any symbol if you know how to reverse it.

To practice, go to the webshell. Once you are there, create a python script using: 

[source, txt]
nano caesar.py

We will use a python code that encrypts and decrypts only lowercase letters using Caesar cipher. This is how it looks:

[source, python]
----
def caesar_encrypt(text):
    result = ""

    # Go through each character of the text in this for loop
    for i in range(len(text)):

        # Obtain the ASCII value using ord
        char_position = ord(text[i])

        # Substract 97 to have a character from 1 to 26
        char_position = char_position - 97

        # Add 3 to the position, as caesar does
        new_char_position = char_position + 3

        # Make sure that the position does not surpass 26 (we wrap around)
        new_char_position = new_char_position % 26

        # Convert back to ASCII values
        new_char_position = new_char_position + 97

        # Convert ASCII value to character and concatenate it to final result
        result = result + chr(new_char_position)

        print(result)
    return result

def caesar_decrypt(cipher_text):
    result = ""

    # Go through each character of the text in this for loop
    for i in range(len(cipher_text)):

        # Obtain the ASCII value using ord
        char_position = ord(cipher_text[i])

        # Substract 97 to have a character from 1 to 26
        char_position = char_position - 97

        # Substract 3 to the position, to get back original position
        new_char_position = char_position - 3

        # Make sure that the position does not surpass 26 (we wrap around)
        new_char_position = new_char_position % 26

        # Convert back to ASCII values
        new_char_position = new_char_position + 97

        # Convert ASCII value to character and concatenate it to final result
        result = result + chr(new_char_position)

        print(result)
    return result

text = "picoctf"
print(f"Plain Text: {text}")
cipher_text = caesar_encrypt(text)
print(f"Encrypted: {cipher_text}")
print(f"Decrypted: {caesar_decrypt(cipher_text)}")
----
 
Copy and paste the code into the file, save the file by pressing control+x, press enter, and then execute it with:
 
 
[source, txt]
python3 caesar.py
 
You should see the following output:
 
[source, txt]
Plain Text: picoctf

Decrypted: picoctf
 
Read the comments in the python source code to understand it. You probably noted the '%', which is called the modulo operator. That allows us to wrap around a number, because it calculates the remainder of the division. We will see more detail of this in the future, so do not worry too much about it for now. But, know that if we want a number to start from 0 again if it surpasses certain threshold, we can use modulo operator. In this case, we use it because we only have 26 letters in the english alphabet. So, the first position is 0, which contains 'a', because arrays start at zero. The last position is 25, which contains 'z'. So, if we want to encrypt 'z', we would need to add 3 positions, and 25+3 is 28, but after 25 we need to begin from 0 again because of the way that caesar works. Modulo operator works perfect for that because:
 
26%26 is 0

27%26 is 1

28%26 is 2
 
So, as we said before in an example, the letter 'z' would be encrypted with 'c', which is in the position 2 considering that arrays start at 0. Other thing that you maybe did not understand at once from the code, was that we subtracted 97 from the ASCII value. Go to:
 
http://www.asciitable.com/[.underline]#http://www.asciitable.com/#]
 
Note that the letter 'a', is in the position 97, so we simply subtract 97 to apply the overlap trick with modulo 26. Note that this trick would also work by not subtracting 97, but instead applying the modulo on 123, like in the following code:
 
[source,python]
def caesar_encrypt(text):
    result = ""
    # Go through each character of the text in this for loop
    for i in range(len(text)):
        # Obtain the ASCII value using ord
        char_position = ord(text[i])
        # Add 3 to the position, as caesar does
        new_char_position = char_position + 3
        new_char_position = new_char_position % 123
        # Convert ASCII value to character and concatenate it to final result
        result = result + chr(new_char_position)
        print(result)
    return result
def caesar_decrypt(cipher_text):
    result = ""
    # Go through each character of the text in this for loop
    for i in range(len(cipher_text)):
        # Obtain the ASCII value using ord 
        char_position = ord(cipher_text[i]) 
        # Substract 3 to the position, to get back original position
        new_char_position = char_position - 3
        new_char_position = new_char_position % 123
        # Convert ASCII value to character and concatenate it to final result
        result = result + chr(new_char_position)
        print(result)
    return result
text = "picoctf"
print(f"Plain Text: {text}")
cipher_text = caesar_encrypt(text)
print(f"Encrypted: {cipher_text}")
print(f"Decrypted: {caesar_decrypt(cipher_text)}")
 
Can you explain why?
 
Challenge: Modify the python script to be able to encrypt and decrypt upper case words.

=== Transposition ciphers

In transposition ciphers, we don't replace the letters by other symbols, but we simply change the order in which they appear on the cleartext. For example, we can decide that our encryption algorithm simply moves the letters to the right and overlaps. Let's encrypt the word 'pico' by rotating its letters by one position to the right.

clear text -> p i c o

encrypted text -> o p i c

This is a very simple kind of transposition. But you can have a map that makes more complicated transpositions. For instance, you can decide that you will encrypt a text by doing transpositions in chunks of 6 letters using the following mapping:

[.text-center]
.Example of mapping of transposition cipher
image::images/5image1.png[image,width=198,height=222]

The number indicate the position of the letters. Using that mapping, let's encrypt the word 'pico'. Since pico only has 4 letters, we can simply use a padding to complete until 6 letters. For this example, we will use the symbol * as padding, so we have:

[.text-center]
.Applying mapping with padding
image::images/5image2.png[image,width=198,height=222]

The encrypted word is 'c*ip*o' using our arbitrarily defined mapping. Suppose we want to encrypt a long text. In that case we simply apply the same mapping each 6 characters.

So far, we saw how transposition and substitution ciphers work. If they are used only by themselves, they are very easy to crack. On the other hand, if someone finds out the algorithm we use to encrypt, the encryption is broken forever! A way to improve this, is by using encryption algorithms based on a key.

=== Key ciphers

There is a principle in cryptography called the Kerckhoffs's principle that states: "A cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge". That principle pretends to overcome the fact that once the encryption algorithm is known by the enemy the encryption is broken. The solution is to use a key. One old algorithm that was used to encrypt data using a key was "Vigenere". It looks certainly stronger than the previous algorithms we learned. Even though it is easily breakable nowadays, in its time it was considered unbreakable.

To understand how Vigenere works we will encrypt the cleartext:

"I LOVE PITTSBURGH"

First, we remove the spaces, because the Vigenere table does not have the  space. However, a human can easily recognize the words of a text even if it has no spaces. We get:

"ILOVEPITTSBURGH"

Now, we can pick a key. For this example, we will use the key "PICOCTF". Since our text is larger than the key, we simply repeat the key several times until we get the same length in the following manner:

Plaintext: ILOVEPITTSBURGH

Key: PICOCTFPICOCTFP

The first letter of the cleartext is paired with the first letter of the key. So, we have the pair ('I','P') Now in the vigenere table that is presented below, we use row i and column p. The cell at the intersection of the column and the row will be the encrypted letter, which in this case is X. We do the same for the rest of the letters, and we would obtain the following:

Cleartext: ILOVEPITTSBURGH

Key: PICOCTFPICOCTFP

Encrypted text: XTQJGINIBUPWKLW

[.text-center]
.Vigenere table
image::images/5image45.png[align="center",image,width=427,height=301]

Now let's see how decryption works. Suppose we only have the key and the encrypted:

Key: PICOCTFPICOCTFP

Encrypted text: XTQJGINIBUPWKLW

We take the first letter of the key, which is 'P', and go to that row in the vigenere table. Then in the row 'P', we find the first letter of the encrypted text, which is 'X'.The column that corresponds to 'X', is the first letter of the clear text, which in our case is 'I'. You repeat the same process for each character until you get 'ILOVEPITSBURGH'.

To verify that you understand the decryption, decrypt the encrypted text "WMNZQAJ" using the key "HELLO", remember that if the key is shorter, you just repeat it. You should obtain a word you will easily recognize!

Vigenere is easily broken even without a computer. Simon Singh, a famous science communicator, has a nice tool on his website for cracking Vigenere:

https://www.simonsingh.net/The_Black_Chamber/vigenere_cracking_tool.html[[.underline]#https://www.simonsingh.net/The_Black_Chamber/vigenere_cracking_tool.html#]

Cracking ciphers is a field itself called cryptanalysis. Cryptanalysis and Cryptography compose bigger field called Cryptology.

=== Modern cryptography

In modern cryptography exist the concept of symmetric and asymmetric cryptography. Symmetric cryptography means that you use the same key for encryption and decryption like we just did on Vigenere. In asymmetric cryptography you have two keys. One is for encryption, known as the public key, the other one is for decryption, known as the private key. Asymmetric cryptography is useful because it can be used to solve the problem of a key exchange. Additionally, it can be applied for digital signatures that provide integrity and non-repudiation.

==== Symmetric crypto example: AES

A commonly used algorithm today for symmetric cryptography, is AES, which means "Advanced Encryption Standard". This algorithm has a combination of substitutions and transpositions using a key of fixed length. A key of fixed length means that the algorithm can only have a key with a certain size. However, AES has different versions and each version can support a key length of different sizes. The most common versions are AES 128 and AES 256, which have a key length of 128 bits and AES 256 respectively. AES algorithm is considered secure. However, the implementation can be attacked successfully if it has flaws. For example, one famous way to break AES encryption is the Padding Oracle Attack, which allows to successfully crack SSL, an encrypted protocol that was widely used to secure HTTP traffic. However, this is not a weakness of AES, but a weakness in how it is used.

AES has different operation modes. We will analyze two of them to illustrate vulnerabilities that can emerge in their use. These operation modes are "ECB" and "CBC".

===== Operation mode ECB

ECB means Electronic Code Book. In this operation mode we encrypt independently blocks of the clear text according to the key length. For example, if we are using AES 128, we break the clear text in chunks of 128 bits and use AES to encrypt them independently. This causes a problem because it leaks structure in the encrypted text. There is a famous example on the internet about an image of Tux (the penguin from linux) encrypted using AES in ECB operation mode:

Original image: 

[.text-center]
.Tux, the Linux penguin
image::images/5image46.png[image,width=196,height=216] 

Encrypted image using AES on ECB mode:

[.text-center]
.Encrypted penguin using ECB, we still see it, which is bad
image::images/5image47.png[image,width=196,height=216]

Yow can see that is easy to identify that the encrypted image contains the penguin. In other cases, this operation mode can be very bad for other reasons. Suppose you are sending an encrypted text and you know that the first 128 bits contain a name and the second 128 bits contain a date. Imagine that you are an attacker that captures some encrypted messages on different dates. Even if you do not know the key, you could be able to interchange the second block of messages to tamper the date. To understand this better let's look at an example. Suppose you intercept a message sent on May 1, and after some days you intercept another message in on May 8.

Imagine you want to make the receiver think that the second message is from May 1. You could simply replace the blue block by the red block.

[.text-center]
.Blocks of message
image::images/5image3.png[]

Another problem of ECB is that if you send the same message twice, any attacker can see that the same message is being sent again. A secure encryption algorithm should not leak any information about the message. Knowing that the same message was sent in the past can be used to learn details about the communication. It is recommended to never use ECB.

===== Operation mode CBC

A more secure operation mode is CBC, which means Cipher Block Chaining. In this mode we include additional elements. The first one is the initialization vector, a random value with the same size as the key. In AES, the key size is the same as the block size. Remember that in AES we must separate the cleartext in blocks with the same size as the key. Before starting the encryption, we do XOR between the first block of cleartext and the Initialization Vector, then we begin to encrypt using AES with the key of our choice. The initialization vector is different for every message, so if we send the same message twice, it will be different due to the initialization vector. We must attach the initialization vector to the message. Another element we add in this operation mode, is that we do not encrypt blocks independently, but we use the encrypted text from one block and XOR it with the next block of cleartext we want to encrypt. Then, we use AES and the key to encrypt that result. In the following image it is shown the graphical representation of what it was just explained, note that the circle with the cross means XOR:

[.text-center]
.CBC diagram
image::images/5image48.png[image,width=624,height=250]

In AES, the cleartext must be the same size as a multiple of the block size. For example, if you have a cleartext that happens to be shorter than a block, you need to add padding to the cleartext so it matches at least one block. In a case where cleartext is larger than one block, but smaller than two, you need to add padding to the cleartext until it is the same size as two blocks. In AES there is a common way of padding, which is a standard called PKCS #7. In AES 128, as we said previously, the block size is 128 bits, which is equivalent to 16 bytes. Suppose you want to encrypt the message

"HELLOPICOCTF"

Since that message is 12 bytes, we require to add a padding of 4 bytes to complete the size of a block. In PKCS#7 you add padding using a byte with the value of bytes you need to pad. In our example, since we need to pad 4 bytes to complete 16 bytes, we would pad like this:

"HELLOPICOCTF"+"\x04\x04\x04\x04"

Note that "\x" is a way to tell that in a string we want to use that exact number on a byte, even if it is not printable ASCII. Now, suppose we want to encrypt a message of 14 bytes like:

"GOODBYEPICOCTF!"

After we pad it using PKCS#7, the result is:

"GOODBYEPICOCTF!"+"\x01"

What would be the result after padding the message "BYEPICOCTF"?

…

If you answered:

"BYEPICOCTF"+"\x06\x06\x06\x06\x06\x06"

You are correct. 

==== Asymmetric crypto example: RSA

Remember that asymmetric crypto, means that we use one key for encrypting (the public key) and another key for decrypting (the private key). Suppose you want to communicate secretly with asymmetric crypto. In that case, you generate a public and private key pair. Then, give the public key to anyone that wants to send you an encrypted message. They will encrypt the message using your public key and when you receive the encrypted message, you are the only one that can decrypt it, because you are the only one that has the private key. That's why it is called "private". Note that your public key can be of public knowledge and no one would be able to decrypt the message. If you want to send an encrypted message to someone, that person would have to give you their public key.

A very widely used algorithm for asymmetric cryptography is RSA. It is called RSA because of its inventors: Ronald **R**ivest, Adi **S**hamir, and Leonard **A**dleman. To understand how it works, we will encrypt and decrypt using RSA algorithm with a public-private key pair that was generated for this example; it will seem a bit magical. After that, we will understand some concepts, learn to generate keys, and encrypt and decrypt with the generated keys.

Before encrypting, you need to understand how it works the modulo operation if you do not know already. It is actually very simple. The modulo operation finds the remainder after division of one number by another. For example, 8 mod 3 = 2, because 3 fits in 8 two times, and we have a reminder of 2. Since RSA uses very basic arithmetic, we are ready to see the example. In RSA, the public key is a pair of numbers, as well as the private key. The message can be anything that we can represent as a number. In a computer, everything is a number as we know. The encrypted text, also called ciphertext, will be another number. In summary, this what we need in RSA to encrypt and decrypt:

RSA public key: Is a pair of numbers (e,n)

RSA private key: Is a pair of numbers (d,n)

Message: m

Ciphertex: c

To encrypt: m^e^ mod n = c

To decrypt: c^d^ mod n = m

Basically, 'd' is the private value of the private key, since 'n' is also in the public key. As you just saw, the formulas are very simple. To encrypt a message, you simply take the message to the power of 'e', and then do modulo 'n'. To decrypt, take the ciphertext to the power of 'd', and then do modulo 'n', and that would result in the original message. In this example the numbers of the keys are very small, which is insecure in real life. RSA is only secure when large values are used. By 2019, RSA is considered secure only if the key is a number that would take at least 2048 bits. Which is roughly *617 digits*. This is how it looks as a 617 digit number:

[source, text]
639792933441952154134189948544473456738316249934191318148092777710386387734317720754565453220777092120190516609628049092636019759882816133231666365286193266863360627356763035447762803504507772355471058595487027908143562401451718062464362679456127531813407833033625423278394497538243720583531147711992606381334677687969597030983391307710987040859133746414428227726346594704745878477872019277152807317679077071572134447306057007334924369311383504931631284042512192565179806941135280131470130478164378851852909285452011658393419656213491434159562586586557055269049652098580338507224264829397285847831630577775606888764

This is certainly a very big number. However, to understand how it works it is a good idea to use small numbers. Let's look at an example:


Public key (e,n) -> (11,117)

Private key (d,n) -> (35,117)

Message m –> 10

So far, we have a private key which has an e=11, and a public key with a d=35. Our message is 10. To encrypt 10, we do:

10^11^ mod 117

The result of that is 82. So, we have:

10^11^ mod 117 = 82

Ciphertext -> 82

Now, for decrypting, we do:

82^35^ mod 117 = 10

Cleartext -> 10

That was a bit magical. The RSA private and public key are generated with steps that make them have this property. The process of key generation is relatively simple. We only need to understand some parts of it to show our attack. Note that "In number theory, two integers a and b are said to be relatively prime, mutually prime, or coprime (also written co-prime) if the only positive integer (factor) that divides both of them is 1. Consequently, any prime number that divides one does not divide the other. This is equivalent to their greatest common divisor (gcd) being 1"footnote:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprime_integers[[.underline]#https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprime_integers#]]. The multiplicative inverse is a number that we use to multiply another number, and obtain 1 as a result. For example, in non-integer arithmetic (in RSA we only use integer arithmetic) the multiplicative inverse of 8, is 1/8, Because 8 * 1/8=1. However, in integer arithmetic we don't have fractions. But we can have a multiplicative inverse modulo n, which means that if we have a number, multiply it by its multiplicative inverse, and take modulo n, the result will be 1.

For example, the multiplicative inverse in 3 modulo 4, is 3, Why? Because if you multiply 3*3, that results in 9, and 9 modulo 4, is 1. Now you are ready to see the key generation without getting lost. This is it:

* Generate two large co-prime numbers, p and q.
* Find n = pq and phi = (p-1) (q-1)
* Select e such that 1 < e < phi, and e is coprime of phi
* Find d, which is the multiplicative inverse of e modulo phi.
* The couple (e, n) is the public key
* The couple (d, n) is the private key


It is relatively simple! To find a multiplicative inverse, you can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm (EEA). In google it is easy to find an online implementation of it. Remember our example in which we had these key pair?

Public key (e,n) -> (11,117)

Private key (d,n) -> (35,117)

That was generated in the same manner. First, we picked two coprime numbers. The numbers of our choice were:

p=13

q=9

They are coprime, because their greatest common divisor is 1. Then

n=13*9=117

phi=(13-1)(9-1)=96

To pick e, we arbitrarily pick a number that is greater than 1 and less than phi, and it is coprime with phi. The number 11 complies with those requirements. So

e=11

Now, to obtain 'd' applying the EEA. We can do that on this web site:

https://planetcalc.com/3298/[[.underline]#https://planetcalc.com/3298/#]

We input 11 and 96 in the following manner:

And the result we want is 35. Now we have:

d=35

With those results, we know the private and public keys are:

Public key (e,n) -> (11,117)

Private key (d,n) -> (35,117)

*Exercise*: Create your own public and private key, and use it to encrypt and decrypt a two digit number!

===== Attacking RSA

RSA can be easily broken if it has a small 'n'. This does not happen often in real life, unless a programmer decides to implement their own version of RSA. A programmer should not make their own implementations of cryptography, it is a general rule to use libraries tested by industry. The security of RSA is based on the fact that there is not an efficient algorithm to factorize a large 'n', so an attacker is not able to generate the private key from the public key. In case 'n' is too small, it is possible to factorize it.

We are going to see how to break RSA by recovering the private key from the public. In real life, the public key comes in a digital certificate, which is a package that contains data related to the owner of the public key along with the public key itself. Digital certificates are often encoded in base64, which is a way of encoding a binary as a printable text. The following is an example of a digital certificate encoded in base64:

-----END CERTIFICATE-----

Copy that text into a text file on the webshell, and name it "weak_n_certificate". The first thing we must do to crack RSA with a weak n, is to extract the n from the certificate. Remember that n is the modulus and e is the exponent.
You can use the following command to extract those values:

[source, text]
openssl x509 -in weak_n_certificate -text -noout

In this case, 

n= 4966306421059967

e= 65537

Factorize that n is easy. If you google "integer factorization online", the first result is this one:

https://www.alpertron.com.ar/ECM.HTM[[.underline]#https://www.alpertron.com.ar/ECM.HTM#]

Input the value of n in the text field on that website, and click the button factor. You will get the following:

That is correct, 67867967 and 73176001 happen to be 'p' and 'q' in the RSA public key. Having those to values, you are be able to calculate the private key.

*Challenge*: what is the private key?

==== Hashing

Imagine you want to download a big file from the internet. However, after downloading, you want to check that every bit of the file is correct, and nothing was changed because of a transmission error or a malicious attacker. To do this, you can use a hash, which is a value that you get after applying a hash function to the file, and you obtain a string of fixed length that identifies that file. Whenever you apply the hash function to the file, you will get exactly the same hash, unless the file has been modified. If one bit of the file was changed, you would get a very different hash. So, using a hash we can check the integrity.

There are several hash functions used in industry that are considered secure. One that is commonly used, is SHA2, which means "Secure Hashing Algorithm 2", because it is the second version of SHA. Let's look at an example. Open the webshell and create a file called "bio.txt" and copy paste the following content (do not include the quotes and make sure there is not break line at the end or beginning):

"Charles Babbage KH FRS (26 December 1791 – 18 October 1871) was an English polymath. A mathematician, philosopher, inventor and mechanical engineer, Babbage originated the concept of a digital programmable computer."

Save it, and run the command "sha256sum" like this:

[source, text]
sha256sum bio.txt

As a result, you should get a hex string of 64 characters. In this particular text, you should get:

[source, text]
338f1cefc564f86ecfc241310d35e31125bb14cff61c080f293be2ef24fb3a69

That string is an identification for the information contained in our file. If we make just a little change to the file, it will change completely. For example, create a new file called "bio2.txt" with the same data, but now without the dot at the end:

"Charles Babbage KH FRS (26 December 1791 – 18 October 1871) was an English polymath. A mathematician, philosopher, inventor and mechanical engineer, Babbage originated the concept of a digital programmable computer"

Save it, and run the command "sha256sum" like this:

sha256sum bio2.txt

You should get:

3e7e604c81440507f6140becfed1c3510bc49cc4745c938166b9979245215618

Note that the hash is very different just because we removed one single dot. Now, add the dot back at the end in the file bio2.txt, and run "sha256sum" on that file. You should get the original hash that we got from "bio.txt", because the information contained in the file is the same.

If we store a file, calculate the hash, and keep the hash with us, we could know if the file was modified by recalculating the hash and verifying that it matches with the hash we had. This is a very useful integrity measure. One caveat, is that an attacker should not have access to the place in which the hash is stored, because in that case, the attacker would be able to modify the file, recalculate the hash, and replaced the stored hash, so we would not be able to tell that the file was modified.

Hashes are commonly used to store passwords in a database. When a user logs in, the hash of the password is calculated, and it is compared with the hash stored. If they match, we know that the user input the correct password. Note that a fundamental property of hashes is that it is impossible to get the original text from the hash. Because of this, a system administrator would not be able to learn the actual password of users if they have access to the database. In the case of a data breach, when a database is leaked, attackers would not be able to obtain the real password of users.

How can a hash be attacked? In the case of passwords, an attacker can create a table that maps several passwords to their hash by calculating the hash of several words, for example all the words in an english dictionary. In that way, if the attacker finds a hash of the password in the database, and the password was a word present in an english dictionary, it could be possible to map it back to the original password by looking for it in the table. However, if a user picked a secure password, this attack would not work because that secure password with complexity, would not be ina dictionary. Note there are lists of commonly used passwords which contain words in several languages and modifications of them, for example, "Hello_12345". A secure password should be random characters to prevent this attack.

Challenge: The following hash of a password was leaked from a database, and you know the user did not use a strong password.

e7ae6cfee91a324590df7b048dcc9802b7389c1b0d996d474d61c4cbb1253455

Search on google the list of passwords called "rockyou" and generate the hash to find the password that corresponds to the leaked hash!

Hint: you can use python to generate hashes. The hashing algorithm is SHA2.
